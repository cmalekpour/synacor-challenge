- some strings in the game are stored in ascii format
	- these are found in game_text.txt

- others are stored in a more obfuscated format with the use of the function at 1458. The data is stored at offsets in memory and are
	each xored with a different key. The key is generated with the add operation before the call to 1458. Note that strings in memory
	are stored such that the first number is the length of the string (say n) and it is followed immediately by the n characters of the
	string
	- these are found in xored_game_text.txt
	- there are no game codes in this section, however
	- note that at this time, certain strings do not show up because the decompiler interprets them as instructions, not integers
